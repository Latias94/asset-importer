# Changelog

All notable changes to `asset-importer-sys` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.1] - 2025-09-18

### Changed
- Refactored `build.rs` and aligned MSVC runtime selection to avoid Debug CRT across all targets (use RelWithDebInfo on MSVC when Cargo is in debug).
- C++ bridge now avoids `/MDd` and `/MTd` and disables iterator debug to match Rustâ€™s runtime.

### Improved
- Added a stable prebuilt cache under `target/asset-importer-prebuilt/{version}/{target}/{link_type}[-{crt}]`.
- Offline support via `ASSET_IMPORTER_OFFLINE=1` or `CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true`, with graceful fallback to cache.
- Quieter downloads: only prints when an actual network fetch occurs; reuses cached archives and extractions.
- Refined CMake configuration: set `CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY`, enable `CMP0091`, and disable PDB install on Windows.
